BUILDING:
To build this SIC/XE Assembler, you'll need a version of CMake. IUPUI's Tesla server has an up-to-date version that will work.
Run the command "cmake ." in the root directory of the project, and a makefile will be created. We will also provide a premade makefile should there be any issues.

RUNNING:
To run, write "./SICXE-Assembler <filename>",  where <filename> is the location of the SIC/XE assembly file you want to convert.
